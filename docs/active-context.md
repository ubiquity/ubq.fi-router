# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
1. Eliminating documentation drift based on analysis report
2. Enhancing plugin map discovery reliability
3. Improving sitemap generation performance
4. Increasing test coverage for health dashboard

## Recent Changes
- Created core documentation files:
  - `project-brief.md`
  - `product-context.md`
  - `system-patterns.md`
  - `tech-context.md`
- Updated deployment documentation with GitHub token setup
- Added test coverage requirements to health dashboard docs

## Next Steps
1. Complete documentation updates for all core files
2. Refactor plugin map discovery to handle edge cases
3. Optimize sitemap generator for large datasets
4. Implement additional health dashboard tests

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Cloudflare KV for plugin map storage
- Adopting Hono for routing in Cloudflare Workers
- Prioritizing zero-configuration plugin discovery
- Maintaining strict performance budgets for all operations
