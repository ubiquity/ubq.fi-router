# Progress

## What Works
- Plugin discovery (`src/plugin-map-discovery.ts`)
- Service discovery (`src/service-discovery.ts`)
- Basic routing (`src/routing.ts`)
- Sitemap generation (`src/sitemap-generator.ts`)
- Health dashboard API with comprehensive test coverage (>90%) (`src/health-dashboard/api.ts`)
- Cloudflare Workers deployment (`wrangler.toml`)

## What's Left to Build
1. Advanced routing patterns for edge cases
2. Plugin versioning support
3. Automated DNS record updates (`scripts/update-dns-records.ts`)
4. Comprehensive validation tests (`tests/comprehensive-validation.test.ts`)

## Current Status
- Core functionality operational
- Basic routing implemented
- Health dashboard with comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updated

## Known Issues
1. Plugin discovery fails for nested plugins
2. Sitemap generation slow with >100 plugins
3. Health dashboard lacks historical data
4. DNS verification script incomplete (`scripts/verify-dns-fix.ts`)
